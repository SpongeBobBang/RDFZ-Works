Our program are designed to solve 3 typical, procedural problems involving "Complex number" in math. Even though the procedure is complex for a calculater, but the idea is the same, of mindless mathematic calculations, where no mistake should take place. 
We want to come up with the result fast to make FM students' life easier.
